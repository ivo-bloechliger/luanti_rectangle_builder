The Rectangle Builder Mod lets you fill rectangles with a certain type of blocks 
by putting special blocks at three corners of a rectangle, provided you have
enough such blocks in your inventory.
Currently implemented are the default blocks
"cobble", "glass", "pine_wood", "dirt", "mese", "diamondblock" and "silver_sand".
